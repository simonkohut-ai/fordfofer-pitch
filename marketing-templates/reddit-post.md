Hey r/[subreddit]!

I've been working on automating influencer creation for content creators and agencies, and I built something that might interest you.

**The Problem:**
Creating a complete influencer profile takes hours - coming up with identity, writing bios, planning content, creating visuals, etc.

**The Solution:**
I built an AI system that generates everything in 3 minutes:
- Complete influencer identity (name, age, personality, backstory)
- Instagram profile (username, bio, first posts)
- TikTok profile setup
- 7-day content calendar with captions
- AI-generated profile image
- Hashtags and target audience analysis

**How It Works:**
1. You choose a package
2. AI generates everything (3 minutes)
3. You get it via email - ready to use

**Tech Stack:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation
- DALL-E for images
- n8n for automation
- Telegram bot for quick access

**Pricing:**
- Basic: $50 (single profile)
- Complete: $150 (full package with image)
- Agency: $400 (3 profiles)

**Why I Built This:**
I was spending 2-3 hours per influencer profile for clients. This automates 95% of the work, so I can focus on strategy instead of content creation.

**Results So Far:**
- Generated 50+ profiles
- Average delivery time: 3-5 minutes
- 98% customer satisfaction

- Plus you get professional quality

If you're an agency:
- Can generate 10 profiles in 30 minutes
- vs 20 hours manually
- Massive time savings

If you're testing concepts:
- Quick way to validate ideas
- Much cheaper than hiring someone

The Complete package ($150) is the sweet spot - includes everything including the AI-generated image.

Hope that helps!
