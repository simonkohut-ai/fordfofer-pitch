> On 21.12 I’m launching something small but real: an AI-assisted marketing studio for founders and small teams.  
> It’s designed as a console rather than “another SaaS dashboard” – simple static frontend, serverless APIs, Stripe and AI under the hood.  
> If you want a calmer way to run pre-launch marketing without duct-taping tools together, you can join the waitlist here: https://www.golocapo.com/prelaunch

2.
> Pre-launch marketing often turns into a pile of tabs, spreadsheets and half-configured tools.  
> I’ve been building GoLoCapo as a single place to connect landing, waitlist, payments and basic automation.  
> Launching on 21.12. If that sounds useful for you or a client, here’s the pre-launch page: https://www.golocapo.com/prelaunch

3.
> Instead of chasing ad spend, I’m treating this launch as a low-budget, high-trust experiment.  
> The repo, deployment scripts and live site are all visible – it’s meant to be an honest demo of how I think about systems.  
> If you’d like early access or just want to watch, the waitlist is here: https://www.golocapo.com/prelaunch
