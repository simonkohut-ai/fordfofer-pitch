## How We Protect Your Data

### Token Storage

- **Server-Side Only:** All Meta access tokens stored server-side, never in your browser
- **Encrypted at Rest:** Tokens encrypted using Vercel KV/Postgres encryption
- **Never Logged:** Tokens never appear in logs, error messages, or console output
- **Automatic Expiry:** Tokens expire after 60 days (Meta policy) — you'll be prompted to reconnect

### Data Transmission

- **HTTPS Only:** All data transmission encrypted via HTTPS
- **Security Headers:** Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and other security headers enabled
- **CORS Protection:** Same-origin requests only in production

### Input Validation

- **All Inputs Validated:** Length, type, and content validation on all user inputs
- **Injection Prevention:** XSS and injection attack patterns blocked
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse and protects your data

## Why Manual-First Posting Is Safer Than Autopost Tools

### Human Approval Required

Unlike auto-spam tools that post without oversight:

- **Every post requires explicit confirmation** before publishing
- **Preview shown before posting** — you see exactly what will be published
- **No automatic scheduling** without your approval
- **Full control** over when and what gets posted

### Reduced Risk

- **Lower ban risk:** Human oversight reduces policy violations
- **Brand control:** You maintain full control over your voice
- **Compliance:** You can review content for compliance before posting
- **Flexibility:** Post when you're ready, not on a rigid schedule

### Platform Policy Compliance

- **Meta-friendly:** Manual posting aligns with Meta's preferred usage patterns
- **App Review:** Our posting features require Meta App Review (ensures compliance)
- **Transparent:** Clear about what permissions are needed and why

## What Happens If Meta Changes Rules

### Our Commitment

- **We monitor Meta policy changes** and update our integration accordingly
- **We'll notify you** if changes affect your usage
- **We'll provide alternatives** if features become unavailable

### Potential Scenarios

**If Meta restricts posting permissions:**
- We'll disable posting features immediately
- You'll retain access to content generation
- Copy/Share workflow remains available

**If Meta changes OAuth requirements:**
- We'll update the integration to comply
- You may need to reconnect your account
- We'll provide clear instructions

**If Meta bans our app:**
- Content generation continues to work
- Copy/Share workflow continues to work
- We'll work to restore posting access

### Your Options

- **Cancel anytime:** No long-term commitments
- **Export your data:** Request data export at any time
- **Disconnect Meta:** Remove Meta connection anytime from Automation Hub

## Security Best Practices

- **Disconnect if suspicious** activity detected

### Our Practices

- **Regular security audits**
