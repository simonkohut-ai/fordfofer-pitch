# Documentation Audit Complete

**Date:** 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Portfolio/Investor/Partner-Safe  
**Grade:** A / Production-Grade

---

## ✅ Changes Applied

### 1. Date Consistency Clarification
**Added to:** `PROJECT_RECAP.md`, `README.md`, `PORTFOLIO_FLAGSHIP_SUMMARY.md`

**Change:**
> **Status Note:** The platform is production-ready and live, with revenue systems operational ahead of the planned public release on 21.12.2025.

**Why:** Prevents confusion about "future launch" vs "already live". Makes it clear the system is operational now, with a planned public release date.

---

### 2. Wording Update: "Dark Promo" → "Controlled Pre-Launch"
**Changed in:** `PROJECT_RECAP.md`

**Before:** "dark promo release"  
**After:** "controlled pre-launch release"

**Why:** "Dark promo" can be misread externally. "Controlled pre-launch" is clear and professional.

---

### 3. Meta Integration Clarification
**Added to:** `PROJECT_RECAP.md`

**Change:**
> Meta integration is optional and fully sandboxed unless explicitly enabled.

**Why:** Shows platform policy awareness and reduces risk perception.

---

### 4. Technical Clarity: index.html vs home.html
**Updated in:** `PROJECT_RECAP.md`

**Before:** `index.html` - Dashboard/Automation Hub  
**After:** `index.html` - Authenticated dashboard entry point (not public homepage)

**Why:** Prevents confusion about which file is the public homepage.

---

### 5. Strategic Positioning Section
**Added to:** `PROJECT_RECAP.md`, `PORTFOLIO_CASE_STUDY.md`

**Content:**
> This project was built to validate revenue, automation, and operational reliability **before public launch**, not after.
>
> The focus is execution, verification, and real-world constraints—not prototypes.

**Why:** Positions the project as systems-builder work, not demo SaaS.
