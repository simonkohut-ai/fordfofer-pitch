# First Sales Playbook

## Goal

Take money with minimal engineering. Get first 10 paying customers at €149 each.

## Pricing Decision

**Price:** €149 one-time setup + first month free

**Rationale:**
- Low enough to reduce friction
- High enough to filter serious buyers
- One-time setup fee reduces commitment anxiety
- First month free reduces risk

**Positioning:** "Founding Customer Deal" (not "discount")

## Objection Handling (5 Objections + Responses)

### 1. "It's too expensive"

**Response:** "I understand. The €149 is a one-time setup fee, and the first month is free. After that, it's [monthly price]. Compared to hiring a freelancer or spending hours manually, it pays for itself quickly. Would a payment plan help?"

### 2. "I need to think about it"

### 3. "I'm not sure if it's right for me"

**Response:** "Let's figure that out. What's your biggest marketing challenge right now? [Listen] Based on that, here's how we can help: [specific solution]. Does that sound like it would help?"

### 4. "Can I see a demo first?"

**Response:** "Absolutely. We're launching 21.12, but I can show you a quick walkthrough. Book a 15-min demo: [calendly link]. Or, if you want to secure a founding spot now, you can claim it and we'll do the demo after."

### 5. "What if it doesn't work for me?"

**Response:** "We offer a satisfaction guarantee. If it doesn't work for you, you can cancel anytime and get a full refund. The founding customer deal is risk-free. What specific outcome are you looking for?"
