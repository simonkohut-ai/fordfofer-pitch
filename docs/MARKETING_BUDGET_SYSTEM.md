# Marketing Budget System

**Rule:** Marketing budget = money generated by this workspace.  
No paid ads until there is real revenue.

## Budget Sources

Initial revenue can come from:

- **Early access payments** (after launch, once Stripe is fully verified).  
- **Consulting / pilots** using the system for a specific business.  
- **Setup fees** for helping someone adopt the console.  

Until at least one of these is live and proven, the **cash budget is effectively 0** and we rely on time and content instead.

## Allocation Rules (Example)

For every €1 of net revenue:

- **40% – Growth budget**  
  - Email tooling, analytics, small automations.  
  - Later: carefully tested ads or content sponsorships.  

- **40% – Runway / buffer**  
  - Covers hosting, domains, and personal burn.  

- **20% – Tools / infra improvements**  
  - Better observability, design assets, testing, or small one‑time purchases.  

These percentages can be adjusted later, but the key is that **growth money is clearly separate from personal spending**.

## Growth Spend Priority (Once Budget Exists)

1. **Distribution tools**  
   - Email sending, simple analytics, link tracking.  
2. **Content amplification**  
   - Design help, better screenshots, small boosts for high‑performing posts (after they prove themselves).  
3. **Paid ads (later, optional)**  
   - Only after there is a clear, working funnel with proven conversion from waitlist → usage → value.  

No spend should happen **before** the funnel from `/prelaunch` to first value is stable.

## How This Connects to the System

1. **Traffic engines** (`docs/TRAFFIC_ENGINES.md`) turn time into audience entries in `/data/audience.csv`.  
2. **Audience → revenue** happens once early access / pilot offers are safe to run.  
3. **Revenue → budget** follows the allocation rules above.  
4. **Budget → more traffic** by upgrading the tools and reach of the existing traffic engines, not inventing new ones too early.  

The loop is designed to compound slowly but safely: **traffic → audience → data → revenue → budget → better traffic.**
