# Post‑Launch Traffic Switch (21.12+)

What changes on launch day, and what stays the same.

---

## What Changes on 21.12

- **CTA changes**  
  - From “join the waitlist” → “try it now” or “start with the console” (once the path is safe).  
  - `/pricing` can introduce real numbers and a working Stripe flow.  

- **Access unlocks**  
  - Early access invite goes to everyone in `/data/audience.csv` with `intent=medium` or `high`.  
  - Public demo links and documentation become part of normal messaging.  

- **Email blast**  
  - A simple launch email to the waitlist: what it is, how to try it, how to give feedback.

## What Stays the Same

- **One core funnel**  
  - `/` → `/prelaunch` (or equivalent) → pricing → Stripe (once enabled).  
  - No branching into many different offers or landing pages too early.  

- **One main promise**  
  - Console‑first marketing studio for founders and small teams; no pivoting into unrelated tools.  

- **Audience tracking**  
  - `/data/audience.csv` remains the source of truth. Every new user, DM, or collaborator is recorded there.

## Revenue → Budget → More Traffic

1. **Revenue appears** (early access, pilot, or setup).  
2. Apply the **allocation rules** from `MARKETING_BUDGET_SYSTEM.md`.  
3. Use the growth portion to **amplify existing traffic engines**: better content, better tooling, modest boosts.  
4. Do not increase ad complexity until the base funnel (from `/prelaunch` or `/` directly) is consistently converting.  

The launch is not the finish line; it is the point where **cash starts to inform which traffic engines deserve more fuel.**
