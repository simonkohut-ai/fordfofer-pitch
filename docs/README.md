# Docs

This folder centralizes high‑level documentation for the `fordfofer-pitch` repo.

- `START_HERE.md` – overview of the project and where to look first.
- `WHAT_IS_LIVE.md` – current production routes and their status.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` – high‑level architecture (frontend, APIs, payments, AI).

Most older strategy/ops notes still live at the repo root and in `dashboard/`. Over time, they can be migrated or referenced from here.
