# Daily Outreach Playbook – Conversation Machine

**Goal:** Conversations, not conversions. Build relationships that lead to waitlist signups and eventual customers.

---

## Who to DM

**Targets:**
- Founders (solo or small teams)
- Indie hackers / builders
- Small agency owners
- People posting about:
  - Marketing struggles
  - Tool fatigue
  - Pre-launch challenges
  - AI automation interest

**Where:**
- X / Twitter (DMs)
- LinkedIn (InMail or connection + message)
- Discord / Telegram communities
- GitHub (if they engage with repo)

---

## DM structure (personalize each one)

### 1. Context
- Reference something specific they posted/shared
- Show you actually read their content
- Example: "Saw your post about juggling 5 tools for pre-launch..."

### 2. Why you're reaching out
- Brief, honest reason
- Example: "I'm building something that might help with that exact problem..."

### 3. Soft invite to waitlist
- No hard sell
- Frame as "early access" or "see it first"
- Example: "Launching on 21.12. If you want to see it first, waitlist is here: [link]"

---

## Example templates (customize each)

### Template A (problem-focused)
> Hey [name] – saw your post about [specific problem].  
> I'm shipping something on 21.12 that addresses exactly that.  
> If you want early access, waitlist is here: https://www.golocapo.com/prelaunch  
> No pressure, just thought it might be relevant.

### Template B (builder-focused)
> Hey [name] – noticed you're building [their thing].  
> I'm launching a console-first marketing studio on 21.12 – might be useful for your pre-launch.  
> If you want to see it first: https://www.golocapo.com/prelaunch  
> Happy to share what I've learned too.

### Template C (community-focused)
> Hey [name] – saw you in [community/channel].  
> I'm building GoLoCapo (AI-assisted marketing studio) launching 21.12.  
> If you're curious, waitlist is here: https://www.golocapo.com/prelaunch  
> Would love your feedback if you check it out.

## Rules

### Do:
- Personalize every message (change at least 2–3 details)
- Reference something specific they said/posted
- Keep it short (3–4 sentences max)
- End with a soft CTA (waitlist link)
- Follow up if they reply (within 24 hours)

### Don't:
- Copy-paste spam
- Send to people who clearly aren't the target
- Push if they say "not interested"
- Send more than 1 follow-up if no reply
- Use hype language ("revolutionary", "game-changing")

---

## Daily target

**5–10 DMs per day**

- Morning: 3–5 (fresh energy)
- Midday: 2–3 (follow-ups on replies)
- Evening: 2–3 (new targets)

**Quality over quantity:** Better to send 5 personalized messages than 20 generic ones.

---

## Tracking

After each DM:
1. Add them to `/data/audience.csv` if they're new
2. Tag `source` as `dm`
3. Set `intent` based on their response:
   - `high` = asked questions, showed interest
   - `medium` = polite reply, might check it out
   - `low` = no reply or "not interested"
4. Add `notes` with context (what they said, what you said)

---

## Weekly review

- How many DMs sent?
- How many replies?
- How many waitlist signups from DMs?
- Which templates/messages got the best response?
- What should you adjust next week?

**Remember:** The goal is conversations, not immediate conversions. Build trust first, revenue follows.
