# First Revenue Plan – Unlock the Loop

**Purpose:** First revenue unlocks reinvestment, validates seriousness, and signals momentum. Price is symbolic, not optimized.

## Why first revenue matters

### 1. Unlocks reinvestment
- 40% of revenue → marketing budget (per `MARKETING_BUDGET_SYSTEM.md`)
- Can now spend on tools, content amplification, or small ads
- Creates a self-funding loop

### 2. Validates seriousness
- Proves someone is willing to pay
- Shows the offer has value
- Builds confidence for future sales

### 3. Signals momentum
- Can share "first customer" milestone (with permission)
- Creates social proof
- Attracts more serious buyers

## Price philosophy

**Symbolic, not optimized:**
- €49 early access = low barrier, high trust
- €100–500 consulting = fair value for time
- €200–1000 pilot = premium for custom work

**Don't optimize yet:**
- A/B test pricing after 10+ customers
- Focus on getting first 3–5 payments
- Price can increase after launch

## How to get first revenue

### Option 1: Launch day unlock
- On 21.12, `/pricing` becomes active
- Early access button links to Stripe Payment Link
- First 10–20 waitlist members get email with CTA

### Option 2: Pre-launch consulting
- Offer setup help to 2–3 high-intent people
- Frame as "pilot partnership"
- Invoice via Stripe, deliver value, collect feedback

### Option 3: Direct ask
- If someone shows strong interest, ask: "Want early access? It's €49 and unlocks on 21.12."
- No pressure, but make it easy to say yes

## Tracking first revenue

**In `/data/audience.csv`:**
- Tag paying customers with `intent = high` and `notes` includes "paid: €[amount]"

**In `CEO_DASHBOARD.md`:**
- Update "First revenue (yes/no)" to Yes
- Record amount, source, date

**In `MARKETING_BUDGET_SYSTEM.md`:**
- Calculate 40% reinvestment amount
- Document what you'll spend it on

---

## Success criteria

**First revenue achieved when:**
- [ ] At least one payment received
- [ ] Payment source recorded
- [ ] Reinvestment amount calculated
- [ ] Next growth spend planned

**Don't wait for perfect:**
- First payment can be €49 or €500
- It's about unlocking the loop, not optimizing conversion
- Once you have first revenue, the system compounds

**Target:** First revenue before or on 21.12.
