## Rules

### Do:
- Stick to the cadence (consistency > intensity)
- Focus on one thing at a time
- Update metrics daily
- Review weekly

### Don't:
- Skip morning distribution (momentum dies)
- Ignore replies (relationships die)
- Build features during routine time (use separate deep work blocks)
- Check metrics obsessively (once per day is enough)

---

## Emergency protocol

**If you're stuck or demotivated:**
1. Send 5 DMs (action > thinking)
2. Update one doc (momentum > perfection)
3. Review `FINAL_CHECKUP.md` (remind yourself of the plan)
4. Read `KILL_LIST.md` (remember what not to do)

**If you're overwhelmed:**
1. Focus only on `/prelaunch` traffic
2. Send DMs only (no building)
3. Update audience file only (no new features)

---

**Remember:** Small daily actions compound. Big sporadic actions don't.
