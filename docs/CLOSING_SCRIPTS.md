```

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "It's too expensive"

**Response:**
```
I understand. Let me break down the value:

€149 is a one-time setup fee + first month free.

After that, it's [monthly price]. 

Compared to:
• Hiring a freelancer: €500-1000/month
• Spending hours manually: Your time is worth more
• Hiring a marketing agency: €2000+/month

It pays for itself quickly. Plus, you can cancel anytime.

What's your budget? I can work with you.
```

**Alternative (If Budget is Issue):**
```
I understand budget constraints. Here's what I can do:

1. Payment plan: Split €149 into 2 payments
2. Start smaller: We can do a pilot first
3. Wait for launch: Regular pricing might be lower

What works for you?
```

---

### Objection 2: "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
```
Of course. We only have 10 founding spots, so I'd recommend claiming one now to secure your spot.

You can always cancel if you change your mind (satisfaction guarantee).

What specific concerns do you have? I can address them now.
```

**Follow-up:**
```
Hey [Name]!

Just checking in — did you have a chance to think about it?

We have [X] spots left. Happy to answer any questions!

```

### Objection 3: "I'm not sure if it's right for me"

**Response:**
```
Let's figure that out. What's your biggest marketing challenge right now?

[Listen to their answer]

Based on that, here's how we can help: [specific solution].

Does that sound like it would help?

If not, no worries — I can point you to better alternatives.
```

**Alternative:**
```
Totally fair. Here's who it's perfect for:

✅ Founders doing marketing manually
✅ Small teams without dedicated marketing
✅ People spending 5+ hours/week on content

And who it's NOT for:

❌ Large teams with marketing departments
❌ People who enjoy manual content creation
❌ Those who need custom agency work

Which category are you in?
```

---

### Objection 4: "Can I see a demo first?"

**Response:**
```
Absolutely! We're launching 21.12, but I can show you a quick walkthrough.

Book a 15-min demo: [calendly link]

Or, if you want to secure a founding spot now, you can claim it and we'll do the demo after launch.

What works better for you?
```

**Alternative:**
```
Sure! Here's what I can show you:

1. Quick walkthrough video: [link]
2. Live demo: Book 15-min call [calendly]
3. Sample output: I can generate a sample for you

Which would you prefer?
```

---

### Objection 5: "What if it doesn't work for me?"

**Response:**
```
We offer a satisfaction guarantee. If it doesn't work for you:

• Cancel anytime (no questions asked)
• Full refund within 30 days
• Keep everything you've received

The founding customer deal is risk-free.

What specific outcome are you looking for? Let's make sure we can deliver it.
```

**Alternative:**
```
Totally fair concern. Here's our guarantee:

✅ 30-day money-back guarantee
✅ Cancel anytime
✅ No questions asked refund

Plus, we'll work with you to make sure it works. If it doesn't, you get your money back.

What would make it a success for you?
```

---

### Objection 6: "I can do it myself"

**Response:**
```
Totally fair! If you have the time and enjoy the process, that's great.

Our system is for people who:
• Value time over money
• Need consistent posts quickly
• Want to focus on building, not marketing
• Are testing concepts rapidly

If you're creating 1-2 posts/week, doing it yourself makes sense.

But if you need:
• Daily posts
• Quick turnaround
• Consistent quality
• Time to focus on other things

Then automation makes sense.

Want to see examples to compare quality?
```

---

### Objection 7: "I'm not ready yet"

**Response:**
```
No problem. When do you think you'll be ready?

[If they say "soon":]
Great! The founding deal is limited to 10 spots. Want me to hold one for you?

[If they say "not sure":]
Totally understand. Want me to check in with you in [timeframe]? Or would you prefer to join the waitlist and I'll reach out when we launch?

[If they say "never":]
No worries! Thanks for being honest. If anything changes, feel free to reach out.

✅ **Track:** Keep notes on what works

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't Ignore Signals:** If they say no, respect it
❌ **Don't Over-Promise:** Be honest about what you can deliver
❌ **Don't Skip Follow-Ups:** Consistency matters

## Automation Rules

**Every Lead Should:**

1. **Convert** → Move to customer
2. **Disqualify** → Remove from active pipeline
3. **Be Nurtured** → Automated follow-up sequence

**No Lead Should:**
- Fall through cracks
- Get ignored
- Stay in limbo

---

**Remember:** Close deals like a machine. Every lead gets a path forward.
