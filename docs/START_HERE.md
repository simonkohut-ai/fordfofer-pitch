# START HERE

This repo is a **working pitch + codebase** for GoLoCapo, an AI‑assisted marketing studio.

- **Core product:** `dashboard/` – static+serverless app deployed to Vercel and served at `https://www.golocapo.com/`.
- **Supporting assets:** `portfolio/`, `ai-agent/`, `telegram-automation/`, `whop-integration/`, and other automation helpers.
- **Archive/experiments:** `landing-page/` (older “Chiara’s World” site), `chiara-desktop-app/`, `p2ba-console/`, `p2ba-core/`, and various prototypes.

## What to look at first

1. `README.md` (root) – high‑level pitch and repo orientation.  
2. `dashboard/` – live app (HTML, JS, APIs, Vercel config).  
3. `docs/WHAT_IS_LIVE.md` – which routes are expected to work in production.  
4. `one-pager/ONE_PAGER.md` – investor/partner one‑pager.  

## Production vs archive

**Production / active**

- `dashboard/` – GoLoCapo dashboard, APIs, portfolio pages, client microsites.  
- Root `vercel.json` – routes `golocapo.com` into the `dashboard/` app.  

**Supporting (used by ops, scripts, or marketing)**

- `portfolio/` – standalone portfolio HTML (English/Slovak).  
- `ai-agent/`, `telegram-automation/`, `whop-integration/` – optional automation tooling.  

**Archive / historical**

- `landing-page/` and `landing-page.html` – older “Chiara’s World” marketing site.  
- `chiara-desktop-app/`, `p2ba-console/`, `p2ba-core/` – previous experiments kept for reference.  

If you only have 5 minutes, read the root `README.md`, open `https://www.golocapo.com/`, and skim `dashboard/PROJECT_RECAP.md`.
