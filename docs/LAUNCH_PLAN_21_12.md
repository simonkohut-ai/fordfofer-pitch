# Launch Plan – 21.12

**Goal:** Build anticipation and a qualified waitlist for GoLoCapo by 21.12, with zero ad spend.

## Timeline (Now → 21.12)

- **Now – T‑7 days:** Align copy, stabilize `/prelaunch`, and make sure the waitlist works end‑to‑end.  
- **T‑7 → T‑1:** Daily light‑touch posting + DMs pointing to `/prelaunch`.  
- **T‑1 (20.12):** Final checks, write “launch day” posts, and soft‑remind the list.  
- **T (21.12):** Open access for the list first; share public links after.  

## Daily lightweight actions (no ads)

Each day until 21.12:

1. **Post once** on X or LinkedIn:  
   Short message about the 21.12 launch and who it’s for, linking to `https://www.golocapo.com/prelaunch`.  
2. **Send 3–5 personal DMs** to founders/creators you know:  
   Simple: “I’m shipping an AI‑assisted marketing console on 21.12 – want an early look?”  
3. **Update one artifact in this repo**:  
   Screenshot, doc polish, or a small fix captured in git.  
4. **Check `/prelaunch` and `/api/health`** in production (once routing is fixed):  
   Make sure nothing silently broke.  

## Launch Day – Hour‑by‑Hour (rough)

**09:00–10:00**  
- Run final smoke tests (home, `/prelaunch`, `/pricing`, `/api/health`, `/api/checkout-url`).  
- Verify Stripe and any critical env vars.  

**10:00–11:00**  
- Send first access email to the waitlist.  
- Include: what it is, how to try it, how to give feedback.  

**11:00–13:00**  
- Be online in the dashboard and inbox for replies.  
- Capture any issues and fix only critical ones.  

**13:00–15:00**  
- Post launch threads on X/LinkedIn using copy from `assets/LAUNCH_COPY.md`.  
- Share screenshots and link to `/prelaunch` + any public demo route.  

**15:00–End of day**  
- Continue 1:1 conversations and note common questions.  
- Write down learnings for a post‑launch recap.  

## Notes

- Monetization is intentionally **soft‑gated** until everything is stable; the CTA is always “join the waitlist for 21.12”.  
- The focus is on trust and anticipation rather than immediate revenue.  
- Any metrics collected should be simple (signups, replies) and not overstated in pitch materials.
