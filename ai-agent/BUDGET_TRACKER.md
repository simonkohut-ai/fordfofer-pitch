# 💰 Revenue-Based Budget Tracker

**Strategy:** Use money earned from sales to pay for OpenAI API costs

---

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Track Sales** → Every sale goes into revenue tracker
2. **Track API Costs** → Every API call costs money
3. **Auto-Calculate** → See profit after API costs
4. **Reinvest** → Use profit to fund more campaigns

## 💵 Cost vs Revenue

### **API Costs (per campaign):**
- GPT-4o-mini: ~$0.01-0.05 per campaign run
- 10 campaigns/day: ~$0.10-0.50/day
- Monthly: ~$3-15/month

### **Revenue (per sale):**
- Launch special: $75
- Regular: $150
- Agency: $400

### **Break-Even:**
- **1 sale ($75)** = ~1,500-7,500 campaigns
- **1 sale covers MONTHS of API costs!**

---

## 🎯 Strategy

1. **Start Small:** Use free tier or $5-10 initial credit
2. **Make First Sale:** $75 covers API costs for months
3. **Reinvest:** Use profit to scale campaigns
4. **Scale:** More campaigns = more sales = more profit

## 📈 Tracking Formula

```
Revenue from Sales - API Costs = Profit
Profit → Reinvest in more API credits → More campaigns → More sales
```
