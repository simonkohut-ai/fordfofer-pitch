# Deck

This folder is for the **investor/partner pitch deck**.

Suggested files:

- `golocapo-deck.pdf` – main PDF deck ready to share.
- `golocapo-deck.pptx` or `.key` – editable version (optional).

## Suggested slide order

1. **Title** – GoLoCapo / Fordfofer, one‑liner, logo.  
2. **Problem** – 2–3 slides with concrete, founder‑level pain points.  
3. **Solution** – product overview, screenshots of the dashboard and key flows.  
4. **Product Tour** – landing → pre‑launch → pricing → Stripe → War Room.  
5. **Architecture (optional)** – simple diagram from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.  
6. **Market & Target Users** – who this is for, how they operate today.  
7. **Differentiation** – console‑first, static+serverless, operator‑driven.  
8. **Current Status** – what’s live, what’s tested, what’s in progress.  
9. **Roadmap** – next 3–6 milestones (short, realistic).  
10. **Ask** – what you’re looking for (feedback, pilots, collaborators, funding).  
11. **Contact** – email, links, demo URL (`https://www.golocapo.com/`).  

Use screenshots from `/assets` and text from `README.md` and `one-pager/ONE_PAGER.md` to keep everything consistent.
