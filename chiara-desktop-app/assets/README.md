# Icon Placeholder

The icon files are optional. The app will use the default Electron icon if these are missing.

To add custom icons:
1. Create a 256x256 PNG image
2. Save as `icon.png` in this folder
3. Convert to .ico format for Windows
4. Save as `icon.ico` in this folder
5. Rebuild the app

The app works fine without custom icons.
