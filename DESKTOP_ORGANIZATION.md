## 📝 Notes

- Some folders like `barber`, `KOMFORT REALITY REWORK`, `vg rework`, `hp rework`, `kubovcik video`, and `MIKORK` were moved to **Projects** folder. If you want them in **Work and Clients** or **School**, you can move them manually.

- The `Tor Browser` folder was left on the desktop (it's a program folder, not a project).

## 🔄 To Reorganize Again

Run: `ORGANIZE_DESKTOP.bat` from your project folder

Or manually run: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "ORGANIZE_DESKTOP.ps1"`
